The Horror House - Hostage Rescue
by corvalho

The terrorists raided the abandoned house and took as
hostages four ghosts (if that is possible) then:

Counter-Terrorists: Enter the dark house, find 
and rescue the ghost hostages. 
Take out the Terrorists without 
jeopardizing the ghost (...this is crazy).

Terrorists: Prevent Counter-Terrorist
force from rescuing the hostages. 

Other Notes: There are 4 ghost hostages in 
this mission.

Good luck!
