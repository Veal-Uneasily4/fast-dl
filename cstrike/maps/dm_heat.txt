Background: The map is inspired by the movie Heat (1995) by Michael Mann, 
with the location of the bank escape scene based on 444 Flower St, Los Angeles Downtown.


Counter-Terrorists (Police): Prevent the thieves
from escaping the bank with stolen loot.

Terrorists (Thieves): Leave the bank safely before you 
find yourself in the crossfire of the police. 


Notes: Medium-sized map (8:8 spawns) without bomb or hostage objectives.
There are 3 buy zones and the engagements are fast. Buy your equipment quickly
and get cover before you feel the HEAT!
